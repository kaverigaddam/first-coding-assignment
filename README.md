# first-coding-assignment
program for my first coding
How long did you spend on this assignment?
-----I spent about 2 hours on this assignment. Most of the time was spent understanding the problem, researching efficient solutions, and setting up GitHub.
Based on your effort, what letter grade would you say you earned?
----Based on my effort, I would say I earned a B+. I put in a good amount of time and effort to understand and implement the solution.
Based on your solution, what letter grade would you say you earned?
----Looking at my solution, I think I earned an A-. The code works correctly for all the given examples, uses an efficient approach with O(n) time complexity, and includes a main function for testing.
Provide a summary of what doesn't work in your solution, along with an explanation of how you attempted to solve the problem and where you feel you struggled.
--The solution works correctly for the given examples and should work for all cases within the specified constraints. I initially struggled with achieving O(n) time complexity, as my first attempt used nested loops resulting in O(n^2) complexity. I overcame this by learning about and implementing a hash map approach, which allowed me to solve the problem in a single pass through the array. I also found it challenging to set up GitHub at first, but I managed to figure it out after some trial and error.
